 Guidelines for Media Advisory, Press Release, Speaker Prep, and Security Planning.

## Purpose
Any action requires tremendous trust from the community, from partners. Building that trust requires clear planning, resolving concerns and anxieties, and creating a dependable foundation for the _collective vision of all stakeholders_ takes shape.

## Structure
Each item below has a brief description of what it's for, due date, and then how to write it.

There will be completed examples in the _examples_ folder and ready-to-enter templates in the _templates_ folder.

## Media Advisory
### What it's for:
Alerts the press of an upcoming event so that they can plan to attend _as it happens_ and allocate resources to cover it. 

Keep it well under a page. Journalists skim these advisories at best. Save speeches for a blog, press release, or the action itself. Keep it short.

### When it's due:
A week prior to the event _or as soon as details finalize if an emergency_.

### How to structure it (details in template folder):
- [ ] __Logo or Organization Name__
- [ ] __For Release__ _or_ For Immediate Release
  * Date of Release
- [ ] __For More Information Contact__
  * [Lead Person or Organization Name] [Email] [Phone]

- [ ] __EVENT FORMAT AND GOAL, ACTIVE VERBS, UP TO TWO LINES__
  * 'City, State - ' where event occurs followed by not more than 150 words. Keep it brief and reiterate the event's goal, format (march/rally/etc.), key stakeholders, and context in narrative form.

- [ ] Restate What/Who/When/Where. 
  * __What__	Format (march/rally/etc.) and Goal
  * __Who__	Key Stakeholders or Speakers	
  * __When__	Weekday, Month Date, Year from Time AM/PM to End Time AM/PM
  * __Where__	Physical Address of starting location 'plus' directions to nearby transit and parking.

- [ ] '###' on the final line.

## Press Release
### What it's for:
Long form description to the press, community organizations, and politicians of an event that takes place soon or already took place.

### When it's due:
Should be draft by day prior and distributed not more than two days prior and up to the day of the event.

### How to structure it (details in template folder):
- [ ] __Logo or Organization Name__
- [ ] __For Release__ _or_ For Immediate Release
  * Date of Release
- [ ] __For More Information Contact__
  * [Lead Person or Organization Name] [Email] [Phone]

- [ ] __EVENT FORMAT AND GOAL, ACTIVE VERBS, UP TO TWO LINES__
  * One sentence summary of below paragraph(s).
  * 'City, State - ' where event occurs followed by not more than four paraggraphs or 500 words. Keep it brief and reiterate the event's goal, format (march/rally/etc.), key stakeholders, and context in narrative form.

- [ ] '###' on the final line.

## Working with Printing Press
### Union-Made
Use a unionized printing shop and ask that they include their union affliation (sometimes referred to as "the bug" due to small size).

### Timelines
Most printers require a week or two of lead time. Under a week is possible but may incur additional expenses. Make sure to finalize designs and get approval from stakeholders and community partners. 

### Working with Community
Do not use a community organization's logo if they haven't endorsed through internal decision process (union vote, executive committee, etc.). Doing so may decrease confidence in our organization as a trusted partner for future actions.
